# TitanicChallenge
In this challenge, we target to provide complete analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive
.In this project i used Titanic data set   
.The data is cleaned and checked for null values  
.Then i imported libraries and dataset is loaded. Then i analysed the data regarding survival based on factors like AGE, NUMBER OF SIBBLINGS, GENDER,P-CLASS.  
.Then the data is divided into four parts i.e. x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test using sklearn library.  
.Then model is trained using LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.  
.The Accuracy is checked and compared for the above mentioned algorithms.  
.Among the algorithms,KNeighborClassifier gave the best Accuracy i.e 82% which is decent.
